# Version 3.0.0 (2022-02-21)

- Now one can use a `bigq` number for `alpha` in `JackPol`, thanks to the 
'gmpoly' package, and one can use `exact=TRUE` with `algorithm=DK` for 
`ZonalPol`, `ZonalQPol` and `SchurPol`.

- Now one can get a `gmpoly` polynomial with Julia. 


# Version 2.0.0 (2022-02-14)

- New function `Jack_julia`, to evaluate the polynomials with Julia.
