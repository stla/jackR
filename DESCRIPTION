Title: Jack, Zonal, Schur, and Hall-Littlewood Polynomials
Version: 6.0.0.9000
Date: 2024-05-31
Author: Stéphane Laurent
Maintainer: Stéphane Laurent <laurent_step@outlook.fr>
Description: Symbolic calculation and evaluation of the Jack polynomials,
    zonal polynomials, Schur polynomials (possibly skew), Hall-Littlewood 
    polynomials (possibly skew), flagged Schur polynomials (possibly skew),
    and factorial Schur polynomials (possibly skew). 
    Mainly based on Demmel & Koev's paper (2006) 
    <doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01780-1> and Macdonald's book (1995)
    <doi:10.1093/oso/9780198534891.003.0001>. Zonal
    polynomials and Schur polynomials are particular cases of Jack
    polynomials. Zonal polynomials appear in random matrix theory. Schur
    polynomials appear in the field of combinatorics. Hall-Littlewood 
    polynomials, flagged Schur polynomials, and factorial Schur polynomials 
    generalize Schur polynomials.
