Title: Jack, Zonal, and Schur Polynomials
Version: 4.0.9000

Description: Symbolic calculation and evaluation of the Jack polynomials,
    zonal polynomials, and Schur polynomials. Mainly based on Demmel &
    Koev's paper (2006) <doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01780-1>. Zonal
    polynomials and Schur polynomials are particular cases of Jack
    polynomials. Zonal polynomials appear in random matrix theory. Schur
    polynomials appear in the field of combinatorics.
