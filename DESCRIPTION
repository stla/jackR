Title: Jack, Zonal, and Schur Polynomials
Version: 6.0.0.9000
Date: 2024-05-19
Author: Stéphane Laurent
Maintainer: Stéphane Laurent <laurent_step@outlook.fr>
Description: Symbolic calculation and evaluation of the Jack polynomials,
    zonal polynomials, and Schur polynomials. Mainly based on Demmel &
    Koev's paper (2006) <doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01780-1>. Zonal
    polynomials and Schur polynomials are particular cases of Jack
    polynomials. Zonal polynomials appear in random matrix theory. Schur
    polynomials appear in the field of combinatorics. The package can also 
    compute the skew Schur polynomials.
