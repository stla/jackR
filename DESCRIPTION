Title: Jack, Zonal, Schur, and Hall-Littlewood Polynomials
Version: 6.0.0.9000

Maintainer: Stéphane Laurent <laurent_step@outlook.fr>
Description: Symbolic calculation and evaluation of the Jack polynomials,
    zonal polynomials, Schur polynomials, and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. 
    Mainly based on Demmel & Koev's paper (2006) 
    <doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01780-1>. Zonal
    polynomials and Schur polynomials are particular cases of Jack
    polynomials. Zonal polynomials appear in random matrix theory. Schur
    polynomials appear in the field of combinatorics, and Hall-Littlewood 
    polynomials generalize Schur polynomials. The package can also 
    compute the skew Schur polynomials.
